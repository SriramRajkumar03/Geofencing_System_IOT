# Geofencing System using IoT

A Geofencing System implemented using IoT technologies. The system leverages the PlatformIO platform for deployment, ensuring an efficient development workflow. The geofencing system enables users to define and monitor geographical boundaries, sending notifications or triggering actions when IoT devices cross these predefined boundaries. This solution can be used in various applications, such as location-based services, asset tracking, and smart city implementations.
